# Multi-cycle-Mips-Processor
A multi-cycle MIPS processor executes each instruction over multiple shorter clock cycles rather than one long cycle. This design reuses hardware components like the ALU across different execution phases, improving efficiency and allowing higher clock frequencies due to shorter critical paths.
